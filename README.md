# AirBnB Data Science Project

🗓️ **November 2023**

This project explores, cleans, and models AirBnB listings data. Originally created in a Jupyter notebook, the project is now split into modular Python scripts for clarity and reuse.

| 01_setup_imports.py | Importing necessary libraries |
| 02_data_loading.py | Loading datasets |
| 03_data_overview.py | Inspecting dataset structure |
| 04_data_cleaning.py | Cleaning and handling missing values |
| 05_visualizations.py | Exploratory data analysis and plotting |
| 06_feature_engineering.py | Preparing features for modeling |
| 07_modeling.py | Training and evaluating models |
| 08_misc.py | Any other code not categorized above |

## 🧠 Goal

To understand and model AirBnB data using EDA, preprocessing, and ML.

## 🚀 Usage

Run the files sequentially or re-integrate into a notebook for iterative development.
